These are some examples of rendering D3 charts with different technologies:
*SVG (standard D3): No ie8 or ie7 compatibility.  Full transition support.
*Canvas: No ie8 or ie7 compatibility.  Attempted compatibility with webshims (failed).  Full transition support.
*RaphaelJS: Full browser compatibility.  Minimal transition support (in progress).

The purpose is to build charts with full browser compatibility and the same rendering power as D3 with SVG.
